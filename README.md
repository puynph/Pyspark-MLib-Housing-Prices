# Pyspark-MLib-Housing-Prices
## Abstract
In this project, I leverage PySpark to predict median house values using a regression approach. The dataset  contains housing-related features, and the aim is to demonstrate a pipeline for preprocessing data, training a model, and making predictions.

## Requirement
To run this project, ensure you have the following requirements installed:

Python (3.11.5)

PySpark (3.3.4)


[Spark Python Integration Test Result Exceptions](https://community.cloudera.com/t5/Community-Articles/Spark-Python-Integration-Test-Result-Exceptions/ta-p/369007)

[Install PySpark on Windows](https://sparkbyexamples.com/pyspark/how-to-install-and-run-pyspark-on-windows/)
## Implementation
#### Data Preprocessing
The script handles data preprocessing tasks, including handling missing values, feature scaling, and converting categorical variables.

#### Model Training
Use PySpark Linear Regression model on the preprocessed data to predict median house values.
